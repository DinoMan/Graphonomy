# Graphonomy: Universal Human Parsing via Graph Transfer Learning


This repository contains the code for the paper:

[**Graphonomy: Universal Human Parsing via Graph Transfer Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04536)
,Ke Gong, Yiming Gao, Xiaodan Liang, Xiaohui Shen, Meng Wang, Liang Lin.

# Environment and installation
+ Pytorch = 0.4.0
+ torchvision
+ scipy
+ tensorboardX
+ numpy
+ opencv-python
+ matplotlib
+ networkx

   you can install above package by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Getting Started
### Data Preparation
+ You need to download the human parsing dataset, prepare the images and store in `/data/datasets/dataset_name/`.
We recommend to symlink the path to the dataets to `/data/dataset/` as follows

```
# symlink the Pascal-Person-Part dataset for example
ln -s /path_to_Pascal_Person_Part/* data/datasets/pascal/
```
+ The file structure should look like:
```
/Graphonomy
  /data
    /datasets
      /pascal
        /JPEGImages
        /list
        /SegmentationPart
      /CIHP_4w
        /Images
        /lists
        ...  
```
+ The datasets (CIHP & ATR) are available  at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzvH3bSnp3E9ZW9paE9kdkJtM3M?usp=sharing) 
and [baidu drive](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nvqmZBN).
And you also need to download the label with flipped.
Download [cihp_flipped](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aaJyQH-hlZEAsA7iH-mYeK1zLfQi8E2j/view?usp=sharing), unzip and store in `data/datasets/CIHP_4w/`. 
Download [atr_flip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iR8Tn69IbDSM7gq_GG-_s11HCnhPkyG3/view?usp=sharing), unzip and store in `data/datasets/ATR/`.

### Inference
We provide a simply script to get the visualization result for the folder containing images.
Images with extensions .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .JPG, .JPEG, .PNG are accepted.
```shell
# Example of inference
python exp/inference/inference_folder.py  \
--loadmodel /path_to_inference_model \
--img_dir ./img/samples \
--tta 1.0,0.75,0.5,1.25 \
--output_dir ./img/samples_segm
``` 

While `--tta` argument (test-time augmentation, TTA) is not mandatory to be specified (default value: 1.0,0.75,0.5,1.25,1.5,1.75), one can use it to enhance quality of results and autoresize images before passing them to the predicting network. For high-resolution images, such as FullHD, super-resolution TTA can cause occupied GPU memory to increase rapidly.

It is recommended to download current Universal model (preferably) from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWJ54lCBFnzCNz5RTCGQmkVovkY9x8_D/view) or a model trained on CIHP from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eUe18HoH05p0yFUd_sN6GXdTj82aW0m9/view?usp=sharing).

### Training
#### Transfer learning
1. Download the Pascal pretrained model(available soon).
2. Run the `sh train_transfer_cihp.sh`.
3. The results and models are saved in exp/transfer/run/.
4. Evaluation and visualization script is eval_cihp.sh. You only need to change the attribute of `--loadmodel` before you run it.

#### Universal training
1. Download the [pretrained](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WiffKnxaJo50sCC9zroNyHjcnTxGCbk/view?usp=sharing) model and store in /data/pretrained_model/.
2. Run the `sh train_universal.sh`.
3. The results and models are saved in exp/universal/run/.

### Testing 
If you want to evaluate the performance of a pre-trained model on PASCAL-Person-Part or CIHP val/test set, 
simply run the script: `sh eval_cihp/pascal.sh`.
Specify the specific model. And we provide the final model that you can download and store it in /data/pretrained_model/.
